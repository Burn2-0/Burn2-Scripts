# Burn2-Scripts

## Burn2 General Script Library

### Other Files

Just a quick note about other files here:

* There is the 2 _BaseTemplate Files, These are proposed base templates for the putting the scripts into to maintain a standard feel and function.
* .gitignore this is the standard git file to specifically ignore items that might be specific to a users computer. This is to retain privacy and to make sure things that are not required do not get uploaded.
* README.md The Document that is creating this text.

### Naming Schema

Initial thoughts on this is that we go for:

```text
b2[initials]-[category]-[name].lsl
```

Where:

* Initials: Authors initial.
* Category: Where it would go in the official LSL wiki's categorised Library
* Name: A short descriptive title for it.
